question: "How does Hilt work? Explain components, scopes, modules, and bindings."

**Hilt** is a DI framework built on **Dagger** that standardizes DI on Android with predefined **components** tied to Android lifecycles.

**Setup:** annotate the `Application` with `@HiltAndroidApp` (creates the app-level component), and inject into Android classes with `@AndroidEntryPoint`.

**Components & scopes** — Hilt generates a component hierarchy mirroring Android lifecycles; each has a scope annotation:

| Component | Scope | Lifetime |
|---|---|---|
| `SingletonComponent` | `@Singleton` | Application |
| `ActivityRetainedComponent` | `@ActivityRetainedScoped` | across config changes |
| `ViewModelComponent` | `@ViewModelScoped` | a ViewModel |
| `ActivityComponent` | `@ActivityScoped` | an Activity |
| `FragmentComponent` | `@FragmentScoped` | a Fragment |

A **scoped** binding returns the **same instance** within that component's lifetime; **unscoped** returns a new instance each request.

**Providing dependencies:**
- **Constructor injection** — `@Inject constructor(...)`; Hilt knows how to build it.
- **Modules** (`@Module @InstallIn(SomeComponent::class)`) — for types you can't annotate (interfaces, third-party classes):
```kotlin
@Module
@InstallIn(SingletonComponent::class)
object NetworkModule {
    @Provides @Singleton
    fun provideRetrofit(): Retrofit = Retrofit.Builder()...build()
}
```
- **`@Binds`** — bind an **interface** to its implementation efficiently:
```kotlin
@Binds abstract fun bindRepo(impl: UserRepositoryImpl): UserRepository
```

**ViewModels:** annotate with `@HiltViewModel` + `@Inject constructor`; retrieve with `hiltViewModel()` (Compose) or `by viewModels()`.

**Points interviewers want:**
- Hilt is **compile-time** and **type-safe** (Dagger codegen) — errors surface at build time, no reflection, good performance.
- **`@Qualifier`** disambiguates two bindings of the same type (`@AuthClient` vs `@PublicClient` OkHttp).
- **Assisted injection** (`@AssistedInject`) for objects needing both DI-provided and runtime params.
- Match scope to lifecycle — over-scoping (`@Singleton` everything) causes leaks/stale state; under-scoping recreates expensive objects.

**Soundbite:** "Hilt layers standardized, lifecycle-bound components and scopes over Dagger's compile-time DI. Constructor-inject what you can, use `@Module`/`@Provides`/`@Binds` for the rest, scope deliberately to the matching component, and `@Qualifier` to disambiguate."
